									<h2><a href="#">Community Guidelines</a></h2>
									<p>Together, we have established these guidelines and best practices to foster scientific growth and mutual support within our lab.</p>
								</header>	
								<p><b>Overview</b></br>
									The scientific journey can be incredibly inspiring, especially when collaborating within a diverse and talented team. To cultivate a team and lab community where everyone feels respected and welcomed, we have collaboratively developed these guidelines and best practices. Drawing from our varied experiences, we believe the following points are crucial to embrace. This document is dynamic and will evolve over time, serving as a foundational starting point for building a cohesive lab community. Ultimately, it is our everyday actions that foster an encouraging and respectful environment.
									These guidelines were collaboratively created by the Microbiology Theme lab managers and other team members. Last updated in June 2024. An editable version of this document is available for all lab members via our shared drive (add link).
								</p>	
								
								<p><b>We Promote an Inclusive Research Environment</b></br>
									We are committed to fostering a research community enriched by diverse backgrounds and perspectives, which we believe significantly enhances our scientific endeavours. Our aim is to create an environment where every scientist feels welcomed, safe, and respected, regardless of ethnic group, socio-economic background, sex, or gender identity.
									We recognize that academia has historically struggled to provide a diverse and equitable working environment for various racial, cultural, and socio-economic groups. While many issues are systemic and demand extensive changes within academia, the education system, and society at large, we believe that impactful change begins with our own actions. This starts within our group and extends to the life-science community on our campus. Each member of our team is encouraged to help build an inclusive and welcoming community.
									We strongly recommend participation in mentoring courses and employing of the diversity and science resources linked below. Be particularly mindful of the harmful effects of microaggressions and the unconscious biases that can influence our actions. Recognize the potential challenges that may arise when individuals from different social and cultural backgrounds collaborate. Communicate openly if you observe any conflicts.
									Harassment should have no place in our community, but if you experience or witness any form of harassment, please report it immediately. Use the reporting and mediation resources provided by SILS (?).
								</p>

								<p><b>Respecting the Intellectual Contributions of Lab Members</b></br>
									Openly sharing ideas among lab members is crucial for scientific progress. It is vital that every member recognizes and appreciates the intellectual contributions of their colleagues. This is especially important in collaborative projects where multiple people work together. While these collaborations can be highly rewarding and enjoyable, they also bring challenges, such as determining who contributed which idea and assigning author positions. To address these, we should actively discuss and resolve any questions or concerns. Typically, we can find solutions that are satisfactory for everyone, but clear communication is essential.
									We strive to maintain a respectful and open discussion environment where ideas can be freely shared and critically evaluated. Challenges to ideas should always be based on scientific reasoning, and while we may disagree with each other's arguments, we must always respect one another as scientists. We recognize the challenges posed by the hierarchical structure of research groups and the varying levels of experience among members.
								</p>

								<p><b>Safety First! </b></br>
									Safety is our top priority at all times. We operate a biology lab up to biosafety level 2 (BSL 2). Although most of the chemicals and strains we use are not extremely hazardous, any chemical can pose a health risk in large quantities, and some are dangerous even in small amounts. Training requirements and precautionary measures are in place for a reason, and it is crucial that we adhere to these safety procedures. Specifically:
								<b>
								</br>•	Always communicate if you have any safety concerns or doubts.
							 	</br>•	Do not hesitate to reach out to the responsible safety officers for external feedback or if your concerns are not adequately addressed by Jonas or other lab members.
							</br>	•	Exercise extra caution when handling corrosive and toxic chemicals, such as chloroform, trizol, and mercaptoethanol, which are part of our routine protocols.
						</br>	•	Begin experiments only after you have received the necessary training and safety briefings.
					</br>		•	Use BSL2 facilities and the anaerobic hood room only after completing the required training and orientation.

								<p><b>Maintaining the Lab Together </b></br>
									A well-maintained lab is essential for smooth operations and successful experiments. This involves ensuring a sufficient stock of chemicals, availability of consumables, proper maintenance of equipment, and correct waste disposal. While these tasks are typically small, they are vital and require everyone’s fair contribution. Effective communication is key to preventing conflicts. Additionally, all members conducting wet-lab experiments are expected to participate in the lab cleaning day, scheduled at least once a year. For details, please go to labrules MBMFS/MMP version 4.4.
								</p>

								<p><b>Respecting the Experimental Workspace of Others </b></br>
									A common source of frustration in the lab is the unauthorized use of personal bench space, chemical stocks, strains, or other materials. To prevent this, we have a strict rule: Do not use another lab member's personal chemical stocks, assigned bench spaces, or personal pipettes without prior permission. When you ask, colleagues are usually happy to help and provide the necessary resources, but it is essential to ask first. This rule also means that everyone is allowed to manage their own bench areas as they see fit, provided all safety requirements are met. However, please help keep common bench areas clean and take good care of shared pipettes (such as those in the anaerobic tents).
								</p>

								<p><b>Promoting Open Science </b></br>
									We advocate for open science and strive to make our manuscripts and data openly accessible. We particularly encourage the use of appropriate preprint servers. New modeling and analysis tools, as well as significant experimental data, should be shared via openly accessible digital platforms such as eLab journal or suitable data repositories. We have established methods to effectively store raw data for many of our experimental workflows. Please consult with experienced members for guidance.
								</p>

								<p><b>Maintaining a Healthy Work-Life Balance </b></br>
									It’s crucial to maintain a healthy balance between life and work. Although this can be challenging given our dedication to our scientific projects, it's important to find effective ways to recharge and avoid extended work sessions without adequate breaks. We do not expect you to work during weekends or evenings, nor to respond immediately to email messages. If you feel you’re feeling overwhelmed by your projects, please talk with your supervisor.
